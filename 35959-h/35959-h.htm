<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>A Hall in a Castle.</i></p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> JEROME <i>and</i> FLORA.</p></div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> I Can't go at present, Mr. Jerome, for I
expect my Lady every moment to ring,
and if I should be out of the way she will be angry;
and as I am but new in her service&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> She angry! Oh you don't know her
yet&mdash;When you have been a day or two with
her you'll find she is never angry&mdash;She is
the best tempered creature&mdash;and were it not for
her aversion to us men, she would not have a
fault.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> Do you consider that as a fault, Mr.
Jerome?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> To be sure I do&mdash;For my part, I
think she had much better be too fond of us, as
the rest of her sex are.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> Pray, Mr. Jerome, what caused her
aversion to the men?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> I'll tell you, Flora, if it wo'nt make
you melancholy.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> Oh, no, Mr. Jerome&mdash;I like a melancholy
story&mdash;I like dearly to cry, when it is not
on my own account.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> Well then&mdash;When my Lady was only
fifteen she fell deep in love with a fine handsome
young fellow, inferior to her both in rank
and fortune; but my good old Lord, her father,
who doated upon her, was afraid a disappointment
might break her heart, and so consented to
her having him; but he proved so bad a husband
that my poor old Master soon died with grief.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> Poor man!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> Don't cry yet, there's something
worse to come&mdash;My Lady, on this, took such a
dislike to her husband, that he died of grief
too.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> Indeed, Mr. Jerome, this is very
moving. (<i>cries.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> On this&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> I hope there is nothing worse to
come?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> On this, my Lady made a vow to
shut herself up from the whole sex.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> Well, that is more affecting than any
of it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> And she immediately retired to this
lonely castle, where, except the house of Donna
Isabella next door, we have not a neighbour for
miles; and even there we are strangers&mdash;for my
part I have never so much as seen Donna Isabella,
or exchanged a word with any of the servants since
they came to the place&mdash;though indeed they have
not been here above eight days.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> But how long has my Lady kept this
vow of avoiding all your sex?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> Eighteen months.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> Eighteen weeks! what a time!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> Months.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> Months! she has certainly lost her
senses.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> Not she.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> O but I am sure she must have lost
some of them.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> I tell you no.&mdash;But I must leave you
now, Mrs. Flora, for yonder is Don Antonio, and
I believe he is coming this way.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> I thought no man was admitted into
the castle but you, Mr. Jerome?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> Yes; Don Antonio lives here&mdash;but
then he is my Lady's uncle; and you know there
can be no fear of her falling in love with him, as
he is a relation.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> But <i>you</i> are no relation, Mr. Jerome.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> Why, as you say, she might fall in
love with me&mdash;Stranger things have happened&mdash;and
to tell you the truth, she does not seem positive
she shan't, for she bids me keep out of her
sight as much as possible, for fear I should put her
in mind of that handsome villain that brought her
to this retirement.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> Here comes the old Gentleman!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> Then I must go, for he'll be wanting
to say something to you&mdash;he is for ever running
after all the maids&mdash;I am sorry to leave you&mdash;I
am, indeed, Flora; indeed I am&mdash;Oh it would be
a happy thing for me if I could bring myself to
care as little for the women, as my Lady does for
the men. <span class="ex">[<i>Exit&nbsp;Jerome.</i></span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> A fine sweetheart, truly, I have got&mdash;and
if this old fright proves another, I'll be even
with him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Antonio</span>&mdash;<i>She courtesys</i></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> Hah!&mdash;what!&mdash;what is all this!&mdash;what
have we here?&mdash;what have we here?&mdash;a
pretty girl&mdash;a very pretty girl indeed!&mdash;My
niece's new maid, I suppose&mdash;Aye, aye, I had the
other sent about her business&mdash;She must be like
her mistress forsooth, and have nothing to say to a
man&mdash;(<i>going up to Flora</i>) My dear, come this way&mdash;I
think your's is a new face&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> Yes, Sir&mdash;and I think your's is an old
one.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> Hem&mdash;hem.&mdash;Pray what is your
name?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> A very good name&mdash;and I intend never
to change it for a bad one.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> Look in my face&mdash;What do you
blush for?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> For you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> Come, come, no pertness&mdash;but let
me bid you welcome to the castle. (<i>offers to salute her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> No, indeed you shan't.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> I will bid you welcome to the
castle. (<i>after a struggle he salutes her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Flora.</span> Upon my word, Sir, you are very
rude&mdash;How would you like I should serve <i>you</i>
so?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> Do&mdash;Do&mdash;serve me so&mdash;you are very
welcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="wide">JEROME</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> Flora, there's a young woman at the
gate, who says she lives with Donna Isabella, and
wants to speak to you upon some particular business&mdash;Can
your Honor spare her with no inconvenience
to yourself?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> Yes&mdash;Yes&mdash;she may go&mdash;(<i>Exit
Flora and Jerome</i>) A young woman at the gate,
now do I want to bid <i>her</i> welcome to the castle&mdash;a
maid of Donna Isabella, our neighbour&mdash;by the
bye I must bring about an acquaintance with
Donna Isabella and the Countess my niece, if I can,
for I am told Isabella is a very beautiful lady&mdash;and
I should like to bid <i>her</i> welcome to the castle&mdash;but,
notwithstanding all the pains I have taken,
ever since she has arrived, to procure a sight of her,
I have not been able&mdash;I would, however, force
myself into the house, but it seems she has a
young brother, the Marquis, come down on a visit
to her within these three days, and he might take
upon him to resent my gallantry&mdash;and I can't say
I am fond of resentments, rage and hatred&mdash;no,
no, the <i>softer</i> passions possess me wholly. <span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<h4><span class="wide">SCENE II.</span></h4>
<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>A Chamber at</i> DONNA ISABELLA'S.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> ISABELLA <i>followed by the</i> MARQUIS.</p></div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> But my dear sister, did not you seduce
me to this melancholy spot, on a promise that
you would procure me an introduction to the rich
widow, the charming Countess?&mdash;Interest first
prompted my wishes, but since I have beheld her,
it is love.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> Beheld her!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Yes, beheld her&mdash;walking in her
garden&mdash;sitting negligently in an arbor.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> But how?&mdash;How contrive to see
her?&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> From the top of our house, through
a telescope&mdash;but, my dear sister, do bring us a
little nearer, or I'll purchase a speaking trumpet,
and make love to her through it, though my
passion be heard by every soul within a quarter of
a mile.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> I tell you I have great hopes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> But why not accept of her acquaintance,
and prevail on her yourself to see
me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> I tell you again, the letters I expect
from her uncle at Madrid will have more weight
than volumes I could say&mdash;She dare not disobey
him, and <i>must</i> see you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> And yet I would not compel her to
it&mdash;Unless she consents to my acquaintance freely,
without being constrained by force, or deceived
by stratagem, I had rather have recourse
to the top of the house and my telescope again.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> Do not let your scrupulous honor
overcome all your future prospects&mdash;Notwithstanding
these letters will strongly recommend
you, yet it will be with her own consent only
she will yield to the recommendation.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> But when do you expect the letters?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> Every instant&mdash;my servants are now
gone to the Post office.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> I'll fly and see if they are returned.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> Do; for as soon as the letters are arrived,
I would not have you lose a moment but
away, and know your fate at once&mdash;yet if she will
but see you I think with such a person as your's,
there can be little to fear.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> But they tell me she is so austere
since this rigid vow&mdash;so awful&mdash;she will petrify
me with a look.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> Pshaw&mdash;away, and see if the letters
are come.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> I will, and if they are, and I gain
admittance, I'm resolved I will obtain you a
husband within a week, in return, my dear sister,
for your kindness to me.<span class="ex">[<i>Exit&nbsp;Marquis.</i></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> INIS.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> Well, Inis&mdash;I am impatient to hear&mdash;What
success?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Inis.</span> Delightful, Madam&mdash;I have been introduced
to the young Countess&mdash;I first communicated
the intelligence of the pretended plot forming
against her to her waiting-woman, who was
sufficiently alarmed at it, to take me to her Lady
immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> Well.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Inis.</span> And so, Madam, as soon as I was introduced
I fell a crying&mdash;I thought that was the
best way.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> Very well.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Inis.</span> And then, before I discovered what I had
to say, I made her promise not to betray me,
which she did most solemnly, and without the
least reluctance&mdash;and now, Madam, says I, I
live servant with your neighbour, Donna Isabella,
a flighty Lady, who turns every thing serious and
sacred into ridicule; and she has resolved to make
sport of you for pretending an aversion to men,
and for that purpose she has procured recommendations
for you to receive the visits of the
young Marquis her brother, but instead of him,
she purposes to come herself, disguised as a man,
prevail on you to consent to be married to her,
and then throw off the mask, and make you and
your vow the jest of the whole kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> This is all right&mdash;go on.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Inis.</span> On this she thanked me a thousand times
for the discovery.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> But did she say she would receive
me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Inis.</span> Oh yes&mdash;she has promised to receive you
on my account, that my divulging the scheme may
not be detected.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> And she is absolutely resolved to receive
<i>me</i> under the title of my brother?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Inis.</span> You may depend upon it&mdash;but how are
you to proceed now?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> Send my brother to her immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Inis.</span> Your brother!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> Yes&mdash;The Countess, from what you
have told her, will suppose him a woman, receive
him, and consequently suffer a thousand endearing
familiarities; till, charmed by the graces of
his mind and person, she shall love him without
<i>knowing</i> it, and, when she detects the impostor,
be unable to part with him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Inis.</span> And if she is like me, she'll think it the
happiest day of her life&mdash;but have you prepared
your brother how to act his part?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> He has nothing to <i>act</i>, being the very
person he represents, and therefore shall not know
of the art by which he is introduced&mdash;for, except
being a little too attentive to dress and etiquette,
a circumstance which, with his youthful appearance,
favours our design, he is one of the most
amiable young men in the world, and the least
idea of imposition would shock his honour, and
put an end to my scheme.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Inis.</span> Then he is not to know he is to be taken
for a woman.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> Certainly not&mdash;Hush, here he is, now
for my credentials. (<i>taking out letters from her
pocket.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> O with what joy I receive them&mdash;they

hope?&mdash;Nothing to make me appear ridiculous?&mdash;I
would not appear ridiculous for the world.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> All is right&mdash;No, no.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> They are addressed to her uncle!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> Yes, because it will be far more delicate
to be introduced through his means&mdash;but
there is one enclosed to her.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> D'ye think she'll see me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> Yes; I dare say&mdash;There is little doubt
of it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Inis.</span> By my dream last night, I'd lay my life
she will.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Why, what did you dream?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Inis.</span> I dreamt she ordered her servants to
drag your Lordship by force out of the house,
and duck you in the great fish-pond for a whole
hour.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Is that a sign?&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Inis.</span> O yes&mdash;Dreams always go by contraries.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> (<i>Going, returns.</i>) But I know she
is so haughty and reserved, that, <i>should</i> she admit
me, I shall appear confused and awkward.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Inis.</span> So much the better&mdash;she expects you'll
be awkward.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Expects I shall be awkward!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> Pshaw, pshaw&mdash;Hesitate no longer
with your fears, but away&mdash;you know your first
court must be to the uncle, and when you have
been a little time in the house your apprehensions
will vanish.&mdash;Away, away.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> But if she should not condescend
to see me?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Inis.</span> Oh, my Lord, you may depend upon it
she will, because of my dream.</p>

keep your vow&mdash;I always knew the very first man
that came in your way&mdash;crash it would go directly,
but let me persuade you to break it by degrees,
and not let the world say you made no struggle
first.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> Struggle! Now, my dear Uncle,
with all your deep discernment, particularly in
regard to our sex, to see you at last imposed upon

intuition, instinct, love without knowing it&mdash;But,
my dear niece, are you sure you are right?

me&mdash;I can't bear a disappointment in a

might be fatal.</p>

to the Marquis&mdash;and has undertaken this scheme

the fine ladies do. (<i>Mimicks.</i>) Well&mdash;But what

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Your uncle's behaviour, Madam,
has something in it rather extraordinary&mdash;I hope
I have not in any means offended him?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> I can conceal my knowledge of
her no longer. (<i>Aside.</i>) Oh no, my dear, not
at all.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> My dear! (<i>Aside.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> I declare I like you so well&mdash;so
much better than I expected&mdash;I can no longer
treat you with cold reserve&mdash;Come sit down. (<i>They sit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> How kind is this! (<i>Drawing his
chair near to her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> (<i>Looking at him from head to foot.</i>)
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. I protest I can't help laughing&mdash;Ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Ha, ha, ha, ha&mdash;I protest no
more can I&mdash;Sure fate directed me to this heavenly
spot, where ceremony has no share in politeness.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> And did you suppose I should use
any ceremony with such a sweet, sweet fellow as
you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Egad, I'll use no ceremony either.
(<i>Aside.</i>) Thus, on my knees, let me pour my
thanks.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> Oh you artful creature! (<i>Stroking
his cheek.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Art! I disclaim it&mdash;and so do you.&mdash;You
are all pure nature.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> Well, I positively do think you
one of the cleverest of your whole sex.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Thank you&mdash;Thank you&mdash;my
dearest creature. (<i>Kissing her hand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> So negligent&mdash;so easy&mdash;not the
lead awkward or embarrassed!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Egad, I think you as little embarrassed
to the full. (<i>Aside.</i>) My dear Madam,
your charming society has inspired me. (<i>Salutes
her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> Now, if you were really a <i>man</i>,
what would you <i>deserve</i> for that?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Madam! (<i>Astonished.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> I say, if you were <i>really</i> a man,
what would you deserve for that freedom?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> <i>Really</i> a man! Why?&mdash;What?&mdash;Don't
I look like a man?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> Yes&mdash;that you do&mdash;and a sweet
pretty man&mdash;Come, come, don't be frightened&mdash;shake
hands&mdash;I forgive you&mdash;forgive you all your
impertinence&mdash;and, carry the jest as far as you
will, I am resolved not to be angry.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> I am very much obliged to you&mdash;infinitely
obliged to you&mdash;I assure you this favour&mdash;this
honour.&mdash;I don't know what to say&mdash;She
absolutely puts me out of countenance. (<i>Aside.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> What confused?&mdash;Come, resume
your gaiety&mdash;Come, come&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Come, come, then. (<i>seizing her.</i>)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> DON ANTONIO.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> Hah!&mdash;What! Struggling?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> Oh, Uncle, I have been so ill-used
by this Gentleman, that I must beg you will
resent his behaviour.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> How!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> Certainly, my dear, if you <i>have</i> been
used ill.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> Most scandalously&mdash;Frighten her a
little. (<i>Aside to Antonio.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Upon my honour, Sir&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> Zounds, Sir, my niece is one of the
most reserved, prudent young women&mdash;and whosoever
offers an insult to her, it is my place, and
consistent but with my honour, to resent it.&mdash;How
white she looks. (<i>Aside.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Sir, I shall not draw my sword before
the Countess, and therefore I beg you will
put up your's.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> And so I will, my poor Lady&mdash;I
see it has frightened you&mdash;Here, Niece, have you
any hartshorn or drops at hand&mdash;the poor thing
is terrified out of her life. Come, come, my poor
little creature&mdash;Poor thing&mdash;Poor rogue. (<i>He
goes up to sooth him, and the Marquis gives him a
blow.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Don Antonio, this insolence shall
receive the correction it deserves. (<i>Draws.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> She is not in earnest, sure. (<i>Aside.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> I have received many a blow from
a Lady, but never such a one as this!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Do you dare to call me a Lady
again, Sir?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> A Lady, oh no&mdash;you are a tyger,
a fury&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> I never met with such usage!&mdash;Damnation!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> What a profligate she is! I did
not think such a word could come out of a woman's
mouth!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> How, Sir!&mdash;Dare to say that again,
and I'll nail you to the wall.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> (<i>Retreating.</i>) Why, what is all
this about? I won't fight&mdash;I only drew my sword
to frighten you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> To frighten me!&mdash;Did you think I
was to be frightened?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> Why not? You see I am.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Yes, I see, and scorn you for it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> Why, Uncle, the tables are fairly
turned upon you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> Yes, Niece, and I'm much obliged
to you, for your advice in the business&mdash;But you
may depend upon it, I shall take care how I
attempt to frighten one of your sex again. (<i>Going.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Come back, Sir, I insist upon your
coming back, and recalling what you have said&mdash;I
insist upon your begging me pardon for your impertinent
insinuation.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> What insinuation?&mdash;That I think
you a female?&mdash;I am sure there is no offence
meant in that&mdash;for, when I suppose you a woman,
I suppose you what I like better than anything
in the world; what I am never happy without;
and what I even make myself poor, despised,
and ridiculous, in the daily pursuit of.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> And pray, Sir, in what, do I appear
like a woman?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> And pray, Sir, in what, does any
of our modern coxcombs appear like a man?
and yet they don't scruple to call themselves
men.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Then you will not recall your
sentiments and beg my pardon?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> Beg your pardon?&mdash;No&mdash;Yes, yes&mdash;Put
on your petticoats, and I'll fall at your feet
as soon as you please.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> I'll bear this no longer&mdash;Draw. (<i>Marquis draws.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> Here Jerome, Jerome, come and
defend me, where it would be a dishonour to defend
myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> JEROME.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> See, Jerome, how my life is assailed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> Aye, your Honour, I always told
you the women would be the death of you at
last.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> You too, rascal!&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> Well, I declare with her sword in
her hand, she is as fine a creature as ever I saw!&mdash;Oh
you audacious minx.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Scoundrel&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> Sure, your Honour, she must be the
Maid of Orleans.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> I am no maid, Sir.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> I am sorry for your misfortune.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Don Antonio, this treatment I
suppose you inflict as a just recompence for my
presumption in daring to hope for an alliance in
your family, spite of the prejudice which I knew
the Countess had conceived&mdash;I cannot deny the
justice of the accusation&mdash;I came into her house
with the vain hope<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> By no means <i>vain</i>&mdash;I am ready to
comply, be your hopes what they will.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Can I believe what you say real?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> Certainly&mdash;Were you going to say
you hoped to marry me? If you were, call the
Priest, and we'll be married immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> Aye, if that is what your Lordship
wants, the Priest shall tack you together in
five minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> This sudden consent staggers me&mdash;I
was not prepared for it&mdash;one likes a little preparation
before marriage as well as before death. (<i>Aside.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> What! you are cast down&mdash;alarmed&mdash;want
to recant&mdash;but I won't let you&mdash;You
<i>shall</i> marry me&mdash;I insist upon it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> What, directly?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> Yes, directly&mdash;I am in a hurry.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> I believe this is mere trifling&mdash;Swear
you will marry me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> I do swear.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> You are witness to the oath.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio and Jerome.</span> We are witness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> SERVANT <i>with</i> DONNA ISABELLA <i>veiled</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Servant.</span> A Lady, Madam, who says she is
sister to the Marquis.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> Has the Marquis more sisters than
one?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> Then this, I suppose, is your brother?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jerome.</span> Aye, in women's clothes&mdash;O dear,
another fine sight!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> Oh Heavens, if it is a man, take
him out of the room or I shall faint.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> Sister Isabella, when I shall relate
to you the strange reception I have met with in
this house, you will be amazed&mdash;but I think you
will sincerely rejoice at the final event of my visit,
when I tell you it is a solemn promise from this
Lady to become my wife.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> I give you joy most unfeignedly. (<i>Pulls off her veil.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> It is a <i>woman</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> Aye, that it is&mdash;Madam, let me bid
you welcome to the castle. (<i>Goes and salutes her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> (<i>To the Marquis.</i>) Why, what
are you&mdash;(<i>After trembling as if much terrified</i>) an't
<i>you</i> a woman?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Isabel.</span> Countess, I knew you never would
have consented to have seen the Marquis, had he
been introduced into the house as a man, therefore
I formed this stratagem, unknown to him, thus
to bring you together.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> (<i>To the Countess.</i>) Do not droop,
my dearest wife.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> And are you really the Marquis?
What a strange blunder have I made!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Marquis.</span> I am the Marquis&mdash;and it shall be
my future care to banish for ever from your memory,
the recollection of that marriage which has
been the source of so much woe to you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> Donna Isabella, we are all infinitely
obliged to you for this stratagem, by which you
have induced the Countess, innocently to break a
vow, which she could not have kept without drawing
upon herself both ridicule and melancholy&mdash;My
dear Niece, depend upon it, there is but <i>one</i>
vow a woman is authorized to take.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Countess.</span> And what vow is that <i>one</i> Uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Antonio.</span> A vow to <span class="smallcaps">LOVE</span>, <span class="smallcaps">HONOUR</span> and <span class="smallcaps">OBEY</span>.</p>

<p>The misspelling of the name Antonio as Antonis on the character's first
entrance has been corrected. In the prologue, the spelling theee has

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
